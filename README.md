## Project Title: Find Nearby Services

## Project Description
An application to find near by services either according to the location of the browser or an address.

## Motivation:
The motivation was to take advantage of all the new tools that we learnt in the boot camp and learn new features of responsive design, google maps and usage of APIs.

## User Story
A user wants to find specific services around a location. Those services include among others gas stations, banks, cafes and others.

## Instructions:
1.	Select the location. There are two options
a.	Enter an address: the user can enter a complete addres including city state or zip or entering partial address like city or state or only zip.
b.	Keep the address items empty and the location will be found out from the browser.
2.	Enter the type of service.
3.	Enter the radius in meters of where the services are located.

## Results
1.	List of service locations: When clicking on a service the map is centered around the service location.
2.	Map of location: Each location is marked. When clicking on the marker the name and address of the location is displayed.
